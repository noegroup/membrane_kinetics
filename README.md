# Solvent hydrodynamics and membrane kinetics for coarse-grained models

This repository contains various codes for calculation of anisotropic diffusion tensors and first-principle hydrodynamics, to be incorporated in solvent-free coarse-grained membrane models. The theoretical background for the presented calculations are given in [1, 2]. We have demonstrated this approach to reproduce realistic membrane kinetics in [1], using our mesoscopic membrane model [3].
